Limits and Continuity in Higher Dimensions; This concept extends single-variable calculus to functions of several variables. We analyze the behavior of functions as inputs approach certain values. For instance, the limit as (x, y) approaches (a, b) of f(x, y) is L if for every number ε > 0 there is a number δ > 0 such that |f(x, y) - L| < ε whenever 0 < sqrt((x-a)² + (y-b)²) < δ.
Chain Rule in Multiple Dimensions; This is a formula to compute the derivative of a composite function. If z = f(x, y) and x = g(t), y = h(t), then dz/dt = (∂f/∂x)(dx/dt) + (∂f/∂y)(dy/dt).
Jacobians; Jacobians are matrices of first-order partial derivatives. They are used in transformations during integration and when changing variables in multiple integrals. For example, for a transformation from (x, y) to (u, v), the Jacobian determinant J = ∂(u, v)/∂(x, y) = ∂u/∂x * ∂v/∂y - ∂u/∂y * ∂v/∂x.
Hessian Matrices; These are square matrices of second-order partial derivatives. The Hessian matrix for a function f(x, y) would be: [[∂²f/∂x², ∂²f/∂x∂y], [∂²f/∂y∂x, ∂²f/∂y²]].
Lagrange Multipliers; A method for finding maxima and minima of a function under constraints. If we want to maximize/minimize f(x, y) subject to the constraint g(x, y) = 0, we set up the following equations using a new variable, λ (the Lagrange multiplier): ∂f/∂x = λ∂g/∂x and ∂f/∂y = λ∂g/∂y.
Change of Variables in Multiple Integrals; A method to switch from one set of variables to another in an integral, typically using the Jacobian determinant. If I = ∫∫R f(x, y) dxdy, and x = g(u, v), y = h(u, v), then I = ∫∫S f(g(u, v), h(u, v)) |J| dudv, where S is the region R transformed by the change of variables.
Parametric Surfaces and Their Areas; Parametric surfaces are used to describe complex shapes in 3D space. For a surface defined by the vector function r(u, v) = xi(u, v) + yj(u, v) + zk(u, v), the area is given by ∫∫D ||ru x rv|| du dv, where D is the domain of (u, v), and ru and rv are the partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v respectively.
Divergence Theorem; Also known as Gauss's theorem, this theorem relates a flux integral to a triple integral. It's given by ∫∫∫V div F dV = ∫∫S F.n dS, where F is a vector field, V is a volume in space, S is the boundary surface of V, and **nis the outward-pointing unit normal vector on S.
Stokes' Theorem; This theorem relates a surface integral of the curl of a vector field to a line integral around the boundary curve. Given by ∫C F.dr = ∫∫S curl F.n dS, where F is a vector field, C is a curve in space, S is a surface with boundary C, and n is the upward-pointing unit normal vector on S.
Green's Theorem; This theorem relates a line integral around a simple closed curve C to a double integral over the plane region D bounded by C. It's given by ∫C P dx + Q dy = ∫∫D (∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y) dA, where P and Q are functions of (x, y) that have continuous first-order partial derivatives.
Curl and Divergence of Vector Fields; The curl measures the rotational tendency, given by curl F = ∇ x F, and the divergence measures the outward flux, given by div F = ∇.F.
Conservative Vector Fields; A vector field is conservative if its line integral over any closed curve is zero. If F is conservative, then ∫C F.dr = 0 for all closed curves C.
Second Derivative Test in Multivariable Calculics; This test uses the second derivatives of a function to classify critical points, given by D = fxxfyy - (fxy)² at a point (x, y). If D > 0, and fxx > 0 or fyy > 0, the point is a local minimum, if D > 0 and fxx < 0 or fyy < 0, the point is a local maximum. If D < 0, the point is a saddle point.
Implicit Function Theorem; This theorem provides conditions under which a function defined implicitly by a relation can be defined explicitly. If F(x, y) = 0 and ∂F/∂y ≠ 0, then y can be written as a function of x near any point where F(x, y) = 0.
Critical Points and Saddle Points; In multivariable calculus, critical points are where the gradient of a function is the zero vector. For f(x, y), ∇f = 0 gives the critical points. A saddle point is a critical point that is neither a local maximum nor a minimum, found using the Second Derivative Test.
Directional Derivatives; This is a measure of the rate of change of a function in a specific direction. For a function f(x, y) and a unit vector u = [u1, u2] in the direction of the desired derivative, the directional derivative Duf = ∇f.u = f_x u1 + f_y u2, where f_x and f_y are the partial derivatives of f.
Taylor's Theorem in Several Variables; This is an extension of Taylor's theorem in one variable to functions of several variables. If f(x, y) is a function with continuous partial derivatives, its Taylor series around a point (a, b) is f(a, b) + f_x(a, b)(x-a) + f_y(a, b)(y-b) + ..., providing an approximation of f near (a, b).
Level Curves, Surfaces, and Contour Plots; Level curves are the set of input values that produce a given output value for a function of two variables. Similarly, level surfaces are the set of input values that produce a given output value for a function of three variables. Contour plots are graphical representations of level curves. They help visualize multivariable functions.
Gradient Vector Fields; The gradient of a scalar function f(x, y, z) is a vector field whose vectors point in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of f, and whose magnitude is the maximum rate of change. The gradient is given by ∇f = f_xi + f_yj + f_zk.
Tangent Planes; In multivariable calculus, a tangent plane is the best linear approximation to a function at a given point. For a function f(x, y), the equation of the tangent plane at a point (a, b, f(a, b)) is z - f(a, b) = f_x(a, b)(x - a) + f_y(a, b)(y - b).
Normal Lines; In multivariable calculus, a normal line to a surface at a given point is the line perpendicular to the tangent plane at that point. If (a, b, f(a, b)) is a point on the surface of f, the normal line at this point has direction vector ∇f(a, b).
Quadric Surfaces; These are surfaces in space defined by a second degree polynomial. Examples include ellipsoids, hyperboloids, and paraboloids. They have various applications, including in computer graphics, physics, and statistics.
Line Integrals in Vector Fields; This is the integral of a vector field along a curve. For a vector field F and a curve C parameterized by r(t), the line integral is ∫C F.dr = ∫a^b F(r(t)).r'(t) dt.
Arc Length and Curvature in Space; This involves calculating the length of a curve in 3D space and the rate of change of its tangent vector. For a curve C given by a vector function r(t), the arc length from t=a to t=b is L = ∫a^b ||r'(t)|| dt. The curvature, a measure of how sharply the curve bends, is given by κ = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||³.
Parameterizations of Lines and Curves in Space; This involves describing linesand curves in 3D space in terms of parameters. For a line passing through a point a and parallel to a vector v, its parameterization is r(t) = a + tv. For curves, the parameterization can be more complex, usually given as r(t) = f(t)i + g(t)j + h(t)k.
Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates; A method for solving double integrals over regions better suited to polar coordinates. The double integral ∫∫R f(x, y) dA, where R is a region in the xy-plane, transforms to ∫∫R f(r cos θ, r sin θ) r dr dθ in polar coordinates.
Triple Integrals in Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates; These are methods for solving triple integrals over regions better suited to cylindrical or spherical coordinates. A triple integral in cylindrical coordinates uses the variables (r, θ, z), and in spherical coordinates uses the variables (ρ, θ, φ).
Laplacian Operator; The Laplacian operator applies to a scalar function and calculates the divergence of the gradient of the function, denoted as ∇². For a function f(x, y, z), the Laplacian is ∇²f = ∂²f/∂x² + ∂²f/∂y² + ∂²f/∂z². It is used in physics for describing wave behavior, heat conduction, and gravitation.
Inverse and Implicit Function Theorems; These theorems provide conditions under which you can solve for variables implicitly or find the inverse of a function. They are used for proving existence and differentiability of solutions.
Surface Integrals; This is the integration of a function over a surface in 3D space. For a surface S parameterized by r(u, v), the surface integral of f over S is ∫∫S f dS = ∫∫D f(r(u, v)) ||ru x rv|| du dv.
