What is Reinforcement Learning (RL)?; A type of machine learning where an agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing actions and receiving rewards / penalties. The agent's goal is to learn a policy, a mapping of states to actions, that will maximize the cumulative reward over time.

What is the Bellman Equation in RL?; It mathematically describes the relationship between the value of a state and the values of its successor states.

What is the goal of the agent in RL?; The agent's goal is to maximize its cumulative reward, also known as the return. It learns behaviors that lead to higher reward outcomes.

What are states and observations in RL?; States provide a complete description of the state of the world, while observations are partial descriptions that may omit some information. They are often represented using real-valued vectors or matrices.

What are the two types of action spaces in RL?; Action spaces can be discrete, where only a finite number of moves are available, or continuous, where actions are represented by real-valued vectors.

What is a policy in RL?; A policy is a rule used by an agent to decide what actions to take. It can be deterministic, where actions are chosen with certainty, or stochastic, where actions are chosen based on probability distributions.

What are value functions in RL?; Value functions estimate the expected return starting from a particular state or state-action pair. They provide a measure of how good a state or action is.

What are Bellman equations in RL?; Bellman equations are self-consistency equations that describe the relationships between different value functions. They provide a framework for understanding the dynamics and convergence properties of RL algorithms.

What is the connection between optimal action-value function and the optimal policy?; The optimal action-value function, Q^*(s,a), gives the expected return for starting in state s, taking action a, and then acting optimally thereafter. The optimal policy selects actions that maximize Q^*(s,a) in each state.

What is the advantage function in RL?; The advantage function compares the value of a specific action to the average value of all actions in a given state. It provides information on the relative advantage of taking a particular action.

Policy Gradient Theory; Policy gradient theories involve calculations to maximize the expected return or performance of a policy using gradient-based methods. The policy gradient is given as an expected value which can be estimated using a sample mean of trajectories collected using the current policy.

Policy Gradient Implementation; Policy gradient agorithms are implemented in practice by defining a policy network, running epochs of training and calculating loss functions. The loss function includes the log probabilities of actions and the weights associated with each state-action pair.

Expected Grad-Log-Prob (EGLP) Lemma; An important lemma in policy gradients, the EGLP states that the expected gradient of the log probability of a parameterized probability distribution is equal to zero.

Reward-to-Go Policy Gradient; The reward-to-go policy gradient refines the policy gradient expression by reinforcing actions based on rewards obtained after they are taken. It emphasizes the significance of the sequence of future rewards in policy optimization.

Baselines in Policy Gradients; Baselines are functions that only depend on the state and can be added to the policy gradient expression. The on-policy value function is a common choice for a baseline and helps to reduce the variance in the policy gradient estimate.

On-Policy Action-Value Function; The on-policy action value function gives the expected return if a particular action is taken in a particular state while following the policy. It can be used as weights in the policy gradient expression.

Advantage Function; The advantage function is the difference between the action-value function and the value function of a policy, which quantifies how much better or worse an action is compared to other actions.

Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE); GAE is a method used to approximate the advantage function in policy optimization algorithms. It provides a way to adjust between bias and variance in value estimates and is widely employed in popular policy optimization algorithms.

Understanding ε in Policy Optimization Algorithms; In policy optimization algorithms like \pi_{\theta}, ε represents the parameter space of the policy. These parameters are adjusted iteratively in order to maximize expected return.

Applying the Log Derivative Trick in Deriving the Policy Gradient; The log derivative trick is commonly used in deriving the policy gradient. It involves deriving the log of a function and is explicitly done in policy optimization algorithms to get the gradient of the log likelihood of the policy with respect to the policy parameters. 

Role of Neural Networks in Policy Optimization; In policy optimization, neural networks often parameterize the policy and the baseline (value function). They help compute the policy and value estimates for different states and actions, which are then used in the gradient update rule.

Importance of the Reward-to-Go function; The reward-to-go function calculates the summation of future rewards obtained from a specific point in a trajectory until its end. It is crucial in the Reward-to-Go policy gradient which reinforces actions based on the future rewards they lead to. 

Effect of Reinforcing Past Rewards in Policy Optimization; Reinforcing actions based on past rewards often leads to a higher variance in the policy gradient estimate. It is therefore preferred to reinforce actions based on the future rewards they lead to in order to reduce variance and improve learning stability.

Significance of Action-value Function as Weight in Policy Gradient; The on-policy action-value function can be an effective choice as the weight in the policy gradient expression. It gives an estimate of the anticipated return if a certain action is taken in a given state while abiding by the policy.

Choosing Baselines in Policy Optimization; The choice of baselines in policy optimization can significantly influence the efficiency of learning. Though the on-policy value function is commonly used, other functions that depend only on the state can also be used. The right baseline helps to reduce the variance in the policy gradient estimate without introducing bias.

Learning Value Network in Policy Optimization; Learning the value network often involves minimizing a mean-squared-error objective to match estimated values with the returns from the trajectories. The value network is updated concurrently with the policy to ensure it represents the most recent policy.

Underlying Concept of Policy Gradients; The fundamental concept of policy gradients is to increase the probabilities of actions leading to a higher return, and decrease the probabilities of actions leading to a lower return, until the optimal policy is reached.

Function of Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG); VPG is an on-policy algorithm applicable for environments with either discrete or continuous action spaces. It can perform parallelization with MPI, and explores by sampling actions as per the updated version of its stochastic policy.

Gradient of Expected Return; In Policy Gradients, let \pi_{\theta} be a policy with parameters, \theta, and J(\pi_{\theta}) refer to the expected finite-horizon undiscounted return of the policy. The gradient of J(\pi_{\theta}) can be defined using the advantage function for the current policy, and is based on trajectories \tau.

Stochastic Gradient Ascent on Policy Performance; Policy gradient algorithms update \theta via stochastic gradient ascent on policy performance -  \theta_{k+1} = \theta_k + \alpha \nabla_{\theta} J(\pi_{\theta_k}), where α is a tuned learning rate.

Advantage Function Estimates; Policy gradient implementations typically compute advantage function estimates according to the infinite-horizon discounted return, yet otherwise leverage the finite-horizon undiscounted policy gradient calculation.

Balancing Exploration and Exploitation; VPG trains a stochastic policy in an on-policy manner, where exploration occurs by sampling actions per the updated version of its stochastic policy. The degree of randomness in action selection relies on initial conditions and the training process. Over training, the policy becomes less random as it is encouraged to exploit rewards it has discovered, possibly resulting in getting stuck in local optima.

What are the key characteristics of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)?; TRPO is a policy optimization method that seeks to maximize policy performance by taking the largest possible steps, while ensuring that new and old policies remain closely associated through the incorporation of a KL-divergence constraint.

How do the optimization approaches of TRPO and traditional Policy Gradient differ?; While traditional policy gradient algorithms maintain closeness of policies in parameter space which can lead to drastic performance changes, TRPO introduces a trust region defined by KL-divergence to avoid such drastic, potentially detrimental changes, allowing for faster and more robust performance improvements.

What is the role of the Trust Region constraint in TRPO?; The trust region constraint, quantified by the KL-divergence between new and old policies, ensures that the policy updates in TRPO do not result in drastic changes, potentially causing a collapse in policy performance.

What kind of environments can TRPO be used in and what are its capabilities in terms of parallelization?; TRPO operates on-policy and can function in environments with both discrete and continuous action spaces. It also supports parallelism through the use of Message Passing Interface (MPI).

What is the mathematical formulation of a theoretical TRPO update?; The theoretical update in TRPO seeks to maximize the surrogate advantage (the performance of a new policy relative to the old policy using old policy data), subject to a constraint that the average KL-divergence between new and old policies should not exceed a specified limit.

What is the significance of the surrogate advantage and mean KL-divergence in TRPO updates?; The surrogate advantage measures the relative improvement of a new policy over the old one with respect to the old policy data, while the average KL-divergence acts as a safeguard to restrict drastic changes during optimization and prevent the new policy from diverging too much from the old one.

What typical approximations are applied to optimize TRPO constraints?; To facilitate TRPO optimization, approximations around the current parameter set such as the Taylor expansion of the objective (surrogate advantage) and constraint (KL-divergence) are typically applied. 

What is the relationship between the surrogate advantage gradient and the policy gradient?; The gradient of the surrogate advantage function with respect to the policy parameters is equivalent to the policy gradient. This equivalence enables the policy gradient to be calculated more efficiently.

What is the role of the Conjugate Gradient Algorithm in TRPO?; Due to the computational expense of inverting the full Hessian matrix during optimization, TRPO instead employs the Conjugate Gradient algorithm to solve for the descent direction, which only requires the computation of the Hessian-vector product and not the full Hessian matrix.

How does TRPO handle the balance between exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning?; TRPO formulates policies in a stochastic manner, thus performing exploration by sampling actions according to the most recent policy. However, it tends to become slightly deterministic over time by exploiting known rewards. This potentially can lead to local optima, underscoring the challenge of balancing exploration and exploitation.

What is the motivation and purpose of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)?; PPO is designed to answer the similar question as TRPO - how can we maximize policy improvement using current data, without taking steps so large that they cause performance to deteriorate? The PPO methods are simpler in implementation than TRPO yet retain its performance by ensuring new policies stay close to old ones.

What distinguishes PPO-Penalty and PPO-Clip, the two variants of PPO?; While PPO-Penalty resolves a KL-constrained update emulating TRPO by penalizing the KL-divergence in the objective function, PPO-Clip does not introduce a KL term in the objective nor a constraint, but rather applies specialized clipping in the objective function to keep the new policy close to the old.

What is the PPO-Clip algorithm's policy update process?; PPO-Clip updates policies by maximizing an objective function over several SGD steps. The function contains a complex expression that minimizes the ratio of the new policy to the old policy’s probabilities (capped between [1-ε, 1+ε]) and the advantage of the old policy.

What is the mathematical simplification of the PPO-Clip's objective function and how does it make it easier to understand?; The simplified variant of PPO-Clip's objective function provides intuition about PPO's workings. It separates the cases of positive and negative advantage for state-action pairs. Each case includes a floor/ceiling effect: once the ratio of the new to old policy goes beyond or falls short of [1-ε, 1+ε], the objective function ceases to benefit.

How does Advantage affect the PPO-Clip's objective function in either case, positive or negative?; Advantages being positive or negative elucidates the clip effect. In the positive case, making an action more likely will increase the objective function until the ratio of the policy’s probabilities breaches (1+ε) , at which point it's capped. In the negative case, the action becomes less likely regenerating the objective function until the ratio breaches (1-ε), after which it's also limited, ensuring the new policy doesn't diverge too much.

How does the PPO algorithm handle the policy updates compared to standard policy gradient and TRPO with regard to risk for performance collapse?; PPO relies on early stopping for policy updates based on the mean KL-divergence exceeding a specific threshold, thereby mitigating the risk of making too large of a policy update which can lead to performance collapse - a risk identified in standard policy gradient and TRPO.

What strategy is PPO using in terms of exploration versus exploitation?; PPO utilizes an on-policy approach, it explores by sampling actions through its stochastic policy. Over the course of training the randomness in the policy typically decreases emphasizing more on exploiting the known rewards, which can potentially lead the policy towards local optima.

What is the main goal behind the Proximal Policy Optimization and how does it differ from the traditional Policy Gradient?; PPO seeks to improve policy using current data but ensures the steps towards improvement are not so big that they cause a decline in performance. Unlike the traditional Policy Gradient, which can take big steps leading to drastic changes, PPO ensures new policies remain close to old ones making it simpler and more efficient.

What are the two primary variants of PPO?; PPO-Penalty and PPO-Clip are the two variants of Proximal Policy Optimization. PPO-Penalty penalizes the KL-divergence in the objective function to approximate a KL-constrained update. PPO-Clip, on the other hand, utilizes specialized clipping in the objective function to prevent the new policy from diverging drastically from the old one.

What is the purpose of the specialized clipping in PPO-Clip?; The specialized clipping in the objective function of PPO-Clip removes incentives for the new policy to diverge too much from the old one. This approach replaces the constraints or penalization of KL-divergence used in other methods like TRPO or PPO-Penalty.

How does PPO-Clip manage to execute policy updates?; PPO-Clip performs policy updates by maximizing an objective function over several Stochastic Gradient Descent steps. The objective function contains a clipping mechanism that constrains the ratio between the new and old policy’s probabilities and the old policy’s advantage function.

What is the impact of the Advantage being either positive or negative in PPO-Clip’s objective function?; If the Advantage is positive, there is an incentive to increase the likelihood of the action, that is if the ratio of the new to old policy is within (1+ε). Beyond that, the function has a ceiling and will stop benefiting from it. If the Advantage is negative, the function will increase if the action becomes less likely, that is if the ratio of the new to old policy is greater than (1-ε). Beyond that, the function has a floor and will again, stop benefiting from it.

How does the PPO algorithm handle policy updates to avoid performance collapse?; In PPO, if the average KL-divergence between new and old policies exceeds a certain threshold, the gradient steps are halted. This strategy does not allow the algorithm to make drastic changes in policy parameters, reducing the risk of performance collapse.

What is the exploration vs. exploitation trade-off in the PPO algorithm?; PPO uses an on-policy method for exploration by drawing actions based on its recent stochastic policy. As the update rule tends to maximize known rewards, the policy progressively becomes less random, that is, it exploits, which can sometimes lead to local optima.

How does DDPG handle policy and Q-function learning concurrently?; Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) uses off-policy data and the Bellman equation to learn the Q-function and the policy simultaneously. It alternates between approximating the optimal action-value function Q^*(s,a) and the optimal policy a^*(s), tailored specifically for continuous environments.

How does DDPG differ from traditional Q-learning when the action space is continuous?; When the action space is continuous, optimizing \max_a Q^*(s,a) becomes computationally demanding in traditional Q-learning. DDPG overcomes this by approximating the function Q^*(s,a) to be differentiable with respect to the action. Instead of computing the maximum over actions, DDPG evaluates \max_a Q(s,a) by taking the action given by the current policy, a = \mu(s).

What are key characteristics of DDPG?; DDPG is an off-policy algorithm that works exclusively in continuous action spaces. It can be seen as an extension of deep Q-learning tailored to continuous action spaces.

What are the two primary techniques employed in DDPG to minimize MSBE loss function?; DDPG makes use of a Replay Buffer, which is a collection of previous experiences to ensure a wide range of experiences for stable behavior. The other technique is the use of Target Networks, where a second network is used, which closely but regrettably updates with the main network to ensure MSBE minimization stability.

How does DDPG calculate the maximum over actions in the target for continuous action spaces?; DDPG uses a target policy network to compute the action which approximately maximizes the Q-function. Just like the target Q-function, the target policy network is also found by polyak averaging the policy parameters over the course of learning.

How does DDPG handle policy learning?; DDPG learns a deterministic policy which gives the action that maximizes the Q-function. The Q-function is assumed to be differentiable with respect to action, allowing for gradient ascent to be performed to update the policy parameters.

How does DDPG manage exploration versus exploitation trade-off?; DDPG trains a deterministic policy in an off-policy way and uses added noise to the actions at training time to promote exploration. At test time, to see the policy's exploitation of learned actions, the noise is not added to the actions. Some implementations also use a uniform random policy for the first few steps of training for better exploration.

What does the term 'off-policy' signify in DDPG?; 'Off-policy' in DDPG suggests that the algorithm uses a replay buffer, containing old experiences with possibly outdated policies, to train the current policy. This can occur since the optimal Q-function should satisfy the Bellman equation for all possible transitions, making all experienced transitions suitable for Q-function approximation.

Why does DDPG utilize Target Networks?; In DDPG, Target Networks are used to stabilize the minimization of the mean-squared Bellman error loss function. The target is the expected return but critically depends on the same parameters being trained. Target networks, which are delayed versions of the main network, are used to avoid instability in parameters.

What is the significance of the Replay Buffer in DDPG?; A Replay Buffer in DDPG is a collection of previous experiences that ensure a wide range of observations are available for training. This diversity leads to a stable behavior of the algorithm. The buffer should be large enough to contain a range of experiences and some tuning may be necessary for optimal performance.

How does DDPG handle continuous action spaces?; DDPG is specifically designed for continuous action spaces. It assumes that the Q-function is differentiable with respect to action. This allows setting up an efficient, gradient-based learning rule for a deterministic policy that maximizes the Q-function, circumventing the need for calculating the maximum over actions every time an action is to be taken.

How does DDPG ensure effective exploration?; To promote exploration in DDPG, noise is added to the actions during training. This could be thought of injecting stochasticity into the policy, enabling it to try out different actions. Some implementations also use a completely random policy for an initial number of steps to encourage wide exploration.

Why does DDPG employ two separate networks for Q-function and the policy?; DDPG alternates between learning the Q-function and the policy. Each requires a different objective function and separate upgradation rules - Q-function is updated by minimizing Bellman error using experiences from a replay buffer, while the policy is updated through gradient ascent on expected returns. Thus, using two separate networks allows for efficient learning and optimization.

How does DDPG perform at test time?; At test time, DDPG checks the effectiveness of its policy in exploiting what was learnt during the training phase. No noise is added to the actions and only the deterministic policy learned through training guides actions at this stage.

In what situations is DDPG particularly useful?; DDPG is particularly useful in environments with continuous action spaces where traditional Q-learning does not scale well. Its combination of off-policy learning, replay buffer, target networks, and gradient-based policy updates make it an effective choice for such complex settings.

What is Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) and what issues does it address?; The TD3 is an improved version of DDPG, designed to handle the common failure of DDPG where the learned Q-function overestimates Q-values, leading to a broken policy. TD3 introduces three major modifications: Clipped Double-Q Learning, Delayed Policy Updates, and Target Policy Smoothing.

What is Clipped Double-Q Learning in TD3?; In Clipped Double-Q Learning, TD3 learns two Q-functions instead of one and uses the smaller Q-value to form the targets in the Bellman error loss functions. This approach helps mitigate the issue of overestimating Q-values which is common in DDPG.

What role does "Delayed" Policy update play in TD3?; The "Delayed" Policy Updates trick involves updating the policy less frequently than the Q-function. This approach helps to dampen the volatility that arises in DDPG due to policy updates which change the target.

What is the importance of the Target Policy Smoothing trick?; The Target Policy Smoothing trick adds noise to the target action, which makes it harder for the policy to exploit Q-function errors by smoothing out Q-values along changes in action. This trick essentially serves as a regularizer for the algorithm, preventing the Q-function approximator from developing incorrect sharp peaks for some actions.

What are the key features of TD3?; TD3 is an off-policy algorithm and is suitable for environments with continuous action spaces. However, the Spinning Up implementation of TD3 does not support parallelization.

What is the purpose of target policy smoothing in TD3?; Target policy smoothing is a modification to the actions used to form the Q-learning target. It adds clipped noise on each dimension of the action based on the target policy. This modification addresses a failure in DDPG where the Q-function approximator develops an incorrect sharp peak for some actions.

How does TD3 differ from the standard DDPG method in estimating Q-values?; Unlike DDPG where a single Q-function is learned, TD3 concurrently learns two Q-functions. It uses the smaller Q-value for the target function in Bellman error loss functions, helping prevent overestimation in the Q-function.

What is the role of the policy in the TD3 algorithm?; The policy in TD3 is learned by maximizing one of the Q-functions. While this is similar to DDPG, TD3 updates the policy less frequently than the Q-functions, adding stability to the policy training process.

How does TD3 handle the Exploration vs Exploitation dilemma?; TD3 trains a deterministic policy in an off-policy way and adds noise to the policy's actions during training to facilitate exploration. At the beginning of training, actions are sampled from a uniform random distribution over valid actions to improve exploration. During testing, to see how well the policy exploits the learned knowledge, no noise is added to the actions.

What is the significance of TD3's deterministic policy and how does it aid exploration?; TD3 trains a deterministic policy off-policy. To facilitate better exploration, it adds noise to their actions at training time. This is typically an uncorrelated mean-zero Gaussian noise, which encourages the policy to try a wide variety of actions and find useful learning signals.

What is the strategy employed by TD3 during the initial stages of exploration?; TD3 uses a trick at the start of training where the agent takes actions randomly sampled from a uniform distribution over valid actions. This is done for a fixed number of steps at the beginning to help the agent transiently increase exploratory behavior and obtain a diverse set of initial experiences.

What is the effect of the policy exploitation during TD3's evaluation?; During the evaluation or testing phase in TD3, noise is not added to the agent's actions. This helps assess how well the policy exploits what it has learned without the variability added by exploratory noise.

What is the purpose of learning two Q-functions in TD3?; In TD3, learning two Q-functions and using the smaller of the two Q-values to form the targets in the Bellman error loss functions helps to prevent Q-value overestimations, which is a common issue in DDPG leading to policy degradation.

Can TD3 handle environments with discrete action spaces?; No, TD3 is specifically designed to handle environments with continuous action spaces. It is not suitable for environments with discrete action spaces.

How does TD3 update the target in the loss functions?; In TD3, the target for both Q-functions is calculated using whichever of the two Q-functions gives a smaller target value. Then, both Q-functions are updated by regressing to this target.

How do frequency of policy updates in TD3 differ from those in DDPG?; In TD3, the policy is updated less frequently than the Q-functions. This modification is aimed at reducing the volatility that arises in DDPG because of how a policy update changes the target.

What is the connection between target policy smoothing and TD3's improved performance over DDPG?; Target policy smoothing in TD3 acts as a regularizer that prevents the Q-function approximator from developing incorrect sharp peaks for certain actions. This issue in DDPG can cause the policy to quickly exploit that peak, leading to brittle or incorrect behavior. By smoothing out the Q-function over similar actions, target policy smoothing prevents such failures, enhancing TD3's performance over standard DDPG.

The role of entropy in Soft Actor-Critic (SAC); In SAC, the policy optimizes a trade-off between expected return and entropy, where entropy is a measure of randomness in the policy. Hence, increasing entropy results in more exploration, accelerating learning, and possibly preventing policy's premature convergence to a bad local optimum.

The difference between the versions of SAC; There are two variants of SAC - one that uses fixed entropy regularization coefficient and another that varies this coefficient over the course of training to enforce entropy constraint. The entropy-constrained variant tends to be the preferred choice for practitioners.

Contrasting TD3 and SAC; Both SAC and TD3 learn Q-functions with mean squared Bellman error (MSBE) minimization, use the clipped double-Q trick and make use of target Q-networks, obtained by polyak averaging the Q-network parameters over training. However, unlike TD3, SAC includes an entropy regularization term in its target, uses the current policy rather than a target policy to generate next-state actions, and trains a stochastic policy instead of a deterministic one.

The MSBE loss function for Q-functions in SAC; The loss function for Q-functions in SAC regresses to a single shared target which includes a term from SAC's use of entropy regularization and uses actions from the current policy.

Learning a policy in SAC; SAC learns a policy that is optimized to maximize the expected future return and expected future entropy. The reparameterization trick is used, in which a sample from the policy is drawn by computing a deterministic function of state, policy parameters, and independent noise.

Specificities of the SAC policy structure; The SAC policy uses a squashing function (tanh) to ensure that actions are within a finite range and changes the action distribution. Also, it uses a different standard deviation parameterization where the log std devs are represented as outputs from the neural network rather than being state-independent.

The policy loss function in SAC; The policy loss function in SAC is almost the same as the DDPG and TD3 policy optimization except for the min-double-Q trick, the stochasticity, and the entropy term.

Exploration vs. Exploitation in SAC; SAC inherently balances exploration and exploitation through its entropy regularization coefficient. Higher values of this coefficient correspond to more exploration and lower to more exploitation. However, the optimal coefficient may differ across environments and hence could require careful tuning.

Concept of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC); SAC is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes a stochastic policy in an off-policy manner, bridging the gap between stochastic policy optimization and DDPG-style approaches. SAC features entropy regularization which prevents premature convergence to a bad local optimum.

Understanding The Role of Entropy Regularization in SAC; In SAC, entropy regularization is used to influence the exploration-exploitation trade-off. The entropy of a policy indicates the level of randomness, so high entropy policies encourage exploration over exploitation, which can prevent the policy from converging early to a bad local optimum and may accelerate learning in the long run.

SAC and Continuous Action Spaces; The SAC algorithm implemented in the Spinning Up library can only be used for environments with continuous action spaces. An alternate version of SAC can handle discrete action spaces by slightly changing the policy update rule.

SAC as an Off-Policy Algorithm; SAC is an off-policy algorithm which means that it learns from action taken by a policy that is different from the one it's currently optimizing. This trait allows it to learn from a wide variety of past experiences to improve its policy.

Learning Q-functions in SAC; SAC concurrently learns a policy and two Q-functions similarly to TD3 but with some differences. SAC includes an entropy regularization term in the Q-function targets, uses the current policy for next-state actions, and for policy smoothing, SAC's intrinsic stochasticity is sufficient--there is no need for explicit target policy smoothing like in TD3.

Entropy-Regularized Reinforcement Learning; In entropy-regularized reinforcement learning, the agent is given a bonus reward at each time step proportional to the entropy of the policy at that time step. This changes the structure of the value function equations and results in bringing the exploration-exploitation trade-off into the equation.

Differences between DDPG, TD3 and SAC; Both SAC and TD3 learn Q-functions using Mean Squared Bellman Erro (MSBE) minimization. SAC also uses a minimum of two Q-values for learning the policy. SAC incorporates entropy regularization into its target, promoting on-policy exploration, in contrast to DDPG and TD3.

Differences in Policy Structures; Policies used in SAC differ from the ones used in VPG, TRPO, and PPO in terms of the squashing function and how standard deviations are parameterized. The squashing function in SAC keeps actions within a finite range. Plus, the log standard deviations in SAC depend on state in a complex way and are represented as outputs from the neural network.
