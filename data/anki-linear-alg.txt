Vectors; A vector is a mathematical object possessing both magnitude and direction. It is often described as an arrow, starting at one point (origin) and pointing towards another point. In linear algebra, vectors can be added, subtracted, and scaled.

Vector Addition; If we have 2 vectors, we can create a new vector by placing the initial point of one vector at the terminal point of the other vector. The resultant vector extends from the initial point of the original vector to the terminal point of the added vector. This is called vector addition.

Vector Multiplication; There are two types of vector multiplication: scalar multiplication and vector product. In scalar multiplication, we multiply a vector by a scalar (number), and the result is a vector. For the vector product, we multiply 2 vectors and get another vector. The magnitude of the resultant vector is equal to the product of the magnitudes of the original vectors times the sine of the angle between them.

Linear Combinations; In linear algebra, a linear combination of some vectors is the vector that can be obtained by scaling and then adding the vectors.

Dot Product; The dot product, or scalar product, is an operation that takes two equal-sized vectors and returns a single scalar number. The dot product of two vectors reflects the degree to which the vectors point in the same, or opposite, directions.

Matrix; A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are used for various operations like adding, subtracting or multiplication and can represent a system of linear equations.

Matrix Multiplication; In matrix multiplication, the elements in the rows of the first matrix are multiplied correspondingly with elements in the columns of the second matrix and then added to obtain the elements in the resultant matrix.
